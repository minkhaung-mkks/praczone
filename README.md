ChatGPT seems to be unable to generete diverse Biology questions, thus resulting in lots of repeated questions with even the exact same wording.

## Inspiring Potential, Encouraging Dreams: Your Portal to Free Learning

Hi, and thanks for stopping by! This repository houses a project that I hold close to my heart. As a student who has recently returned to the education path via a GED prep school, I found a scarcity of free resources for subjects like Reasoning Through Language Arts (RLA) and Social Studies. This struggle has motivated me to develop this app, which aims to provide a free, comprehensive quiz platform for GED exam preparation.

## You can test it [here](https://prep-learn.vercel.app/)


## üìù Latest Update

05/08/2023 : Gonna finalize the design and finish the app basics tomorrow, then take a break from the app to polish up my skills a bit more before designing the user system.

I have came up with a design but still not too sure about it, I want to evoke a feeling of accomplishment when the screen pops up the current design just seems to be an info window.

I met with a few people today and got their feedback and idea on how to move forward with the app. I also decided to start sharing the app after I get at least a member system working, so that people can keep track of quizzes they finished, share their results and more.

The whole app is pretty much finished except for the summary screen to show the show, I'm currently designing it but tbh dont even have a base idea for it.

I'm trying to get the practice test used at my school, it has much more questions that relates to reading passages instead of my own knowledge, which I found to be a challange right now. ( Still trying T_T )



## üïñ Current Planned Timeline

## Turns out I dont have to go anymore, so more time for this project, but I thinking of pausing any further big updates after the quiz mode, and go back to learning for a while, there were many times during my time coding this that I felt like I was exploring something completely foreign to me and it has only gotten stronger as the app progressed furthered.

Please note these times are the worst possible times, In reality I hope to have everything production ready by mid July

- [x] Launch of the app with just the functions to choose quizes and answer them (June 20th 2023) Progess : 100% DONE
- [x] New method to save answers ( July 20th 2023 ) Crucial for the new Quiz mode.
- [ ] Time Quizes (July 25th 2023) Progress : Might prioritize Quiz Mode Over this
- [ ] Quiz Mode (July 15th 2023) Progress : The complexity is reduced abit, but still need to change how saved answers are stored.
- [ ] Switch to MongoDB for data storage (N/A) Not sure if I wanna switch to Database yet.
- [ ] Login with google (N/A) Not sure if I want to go this route, instead focusing on making the base functions a lot better and more user friendly
- [ ] Login with other providers (N/A)
- [ ] Crash Courses (N/A) Focus switched to diversifying question types.
- [ ] User roles (N/A) Unsure
- [ ] Classes (N/A)

## üåç Why This Matters

This project is particularly dedicated to my peers in Myanmar, who often face difficulties with these subjects due to language barriers and lack of resources. I hope that this quiz app can become an invaluable tool to aid their learning and success.

## üí° The Idea

The Prep&Learn will start by reading from a file and subsequently from a database to generate practice exams. The user will interact with these exams by selecting answers from multiple choices. The ultimate goal is to create a free, accessible resource for GED students everywhere to enhance their studies.

## üõ†Ô∏è The Roadmap

The development of this app will follow a roadmap divided into three categories:

### üéØ Main Features

These are the essential components of the app, and they must be bug-free before the app can be considered ready for launch.

1. Convert text input into a set of questions and answers swiftly.
2. Present the questions to the user for answering.
3. Provide a score to the user upon submission of the exam.
4. Store your unsubmitted data inside local storage to persists through refresh and accidental closing of the tab.

### üéà Add-on Features

These features would be great additions to the app if feasible.

1. User Account system with score tracking.
2. Allow users to upload un-vetted exams to the database, which can be confirmed by me to be displayed on the website.
3. Separate quizzes not only based on subjects but also on individual topics like Government and Civics.
4. Timed quizzes.
5. Crash Courses on the topics
6. Making the app display x^2 as x with a small 2 on top and other math related quirks.

### üåà Dream Features

These features would be awesome to have, but they might be challenging to implement due to their complexity.

1. User roles for teachers and students, and even class grouping. This feature would enable schools to use the app to assign practice work and homework.
2. Identifying the user weaknesses and suggesting quizzes to improve on those.
3. Provide Burmese translation for words on hover or click

## ü§ù Let's Collaborate

I invite like-minded individuals passionate about education to collaborate on this project. Together, we can create an invaluable resource to empower students and help them succeed in their GED journey.
