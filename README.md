## Inspiring Potential, Encouraging Dreams: Your Portal to Free Learning

Hi, and thanks for stopping by! This repository houses a project that I hold close to my heart. As a student who has recently returned to the education path via a GED prep school, I found a scarcity of free resources for subjects like Reasoning Through Language Arts (RLA) and Social Studies. This struggle has motivated me to develop this app, which aims to provide a free, comprehensive quiz platform for GED exam preparation.

## Current Planned Timeline

Please note these times are the worst possible times, In reality I hope to have everything production ready by mid July

Launch of the app with just the functions to choose quizes and answer them (June 10th 2023)
Time Quizes (June 15th 2023)
Switch to MongoDB for data storage (June 20th 2023)
Login with google (June 25th 2023)
Login with other providers (July 2nd 2023)
Login with Username & Password (Unconfirmed but possibly July 10th 2023)
Crash Courses (July 15th 2023)
User roles (July 23th 2023)
Classes (August 3rd 2023)

## üåç Why This Matters

This project is particularly dedicated to my peers in Myanmar, who often face difficulties with these subjects due to language barriers and lack of resources. I hope that this quiz app can become an invaluable tool to aid their learning and success.

## üí° The Idea

The Prep&Learn will start by reading from a file and subsequently from a database to generate practice exams. The user will interact with these exams by selecting answers from multiple choices. The ultimate goal is to create a free, accessible resource for GED students everywhere to enhance their studies.

## üõ†Ô∏è The Roadmap

The development of this app will follow a roadmap divided into three categories:

### üéØ Main Features

These are the essential components of the app, and they must be bug-free before the app can be considered ready for launch.

1. Convert text input into a set of questions and answers swiftly.
2. Present the questions to the user for answering.
3. Provide a score to the user upon submission of the exam.
4. Store your unsubmitted data inside local storage to persists through refresh and accidental closing of the tab.

### üéà Add-on Features

These features would be great additions to the app if feasible.

1. User Account system with score tracking.
2. Allow users to upload un-vetted exams to the database, which can be confirmed by me to be displayed on the website.
3. Separate quizzes not only based on subjects but also on individual topics like Government and Civics.
4. Timed quizzes.
5. Crash Courses on the topics
6. Making the app display x^2 as x with a small 2 on top and other math related quirks.

### üåà Dream Features

These features would be awesome to have, but they might be challenging to implement due to their complexity.

1. User roles for teachers and students, and even class grouping. This feature would enable schools to use the app to assign practice work and homework.
2. Identifying the user weaknesses and suggesting quizzes to improve on those.
3. Provide Burmese translation for words on hover or click

## ü§ù Let's Collaborate

I invite like-minded individuals passionate about education to collaborate on this project. Together, we can create an invaluable resource to empower students and help them succeed in their GED journey.

### Latest Update

I finally managed to fix my PC crashing due to running out of space, turns out there was 13 sec video with file size of 8gb, I dont even know how it happened. Anyway, I can finally work on my PC on days where I'm home, so that would speed up development a lot.
