                Prep & learn mission is to provide free, high-quality educational resources, thus breaking down the
                barriers that often restrict students from accessing essential learning materials. While the current
                focus in on GED exams, this platform is dedicated to assisting you on
                your learning journey by giving you the tools needed to succeed.

                <p class="content">
                    Prep & Learn was born from a personal struggle to find excellent, cost-free practice
                    tests. Studying for the GED exams, I realized the challenge wasn't just in the learning but also in
                    finding the right resources to validate that learning. While paid platforms were available, they
                    remained inaccessible to many in developing countries, including myself, due to their costs. It was this struggle that gave
                    birth to the idea of Prep & Learn.

                <!-- <p class="content">
                    As a self-taught coder, free code camp was indispensable in helping me learn this amazing craft.It
                    taught me not only the value of knowledge but also the power of accessibility. Drawing from this
                    experience, I decided to create this platform, where anyone with interest can come to hone their
                    knowledge without being hindered by economic constraints, because I believe education is the best
                    tool to foster a better tomorrow.

                <p class="content">
                    One of the biggest hurdle any practice test provider face is the amount of manpower required to both create and vet tests for quality and relevance. Prep & Learn solution to this is AI, more specificaly GPT-4, using GPT-4 practice tests can be made in mere minutes. Afterwards, a human instructor or myself review these tests to make sure they are up to standards.
                </p>
                <p class="content">
                    One of the best parts of using GPT-4 is that it doesn’t just give answers—it also explains why those answers are correct. This is a real game-changer, especially for tests like RLA where understanding why an answer is right can sometimes be tricky. Additionally, these explanations also serve as handy, bite-sized study notes, helping students remember important info. So, you're not just practicing, you're learning too!

                <p class="content">
                    However this doesn't come free of limitation, one of the biggest is the training data cut off of GPT-4, which means some informations might be incorrect and it is up to us to find out.

                    Moreover, these AI-generated practice tests are excellent for reinforcing your study knowledge but aren't designed to fully prepare you for the actual exam. Many of our tests serve as great refreshers for concepts you've learned, while the real exam always has a unique set of questions and style that might not mirror the generated tests.
                </p>
                <p class="content">
                    That's where partnerships with educational institutions come into play. With their understanding of how GED exam questions work,combined with AI-created contents, Prep & learn will be more able to prepare students for their exams.
