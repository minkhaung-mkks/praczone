                <p class="content">
                    Prep & Learn was born from a personal struggle to find excellent, cost-free practice
                    tests. Studying for the GED exams, I realized the challenge wasn't just in the learning but also in
                    finding the right resources to validate that learning. While paid platforms were available, they
                    remained inaccessible to many, including myself, due to their costs. It was this struggle that gave
                    birth to the idea of Prep & Learn.

                    As a self-taught coder, free code camp was indispensable in helping me learn this amazing craft.It
                    taught me not only the value of knowledge but also the power of accessibility. Drawing from this
                    experience, I decided to create this platform, where anyone with interest can come to hone their
                    knowledge without being hindered by economic constraints, because I believe education is the best
                    tool to foster a better tomorrow.
